### Project description

The project will take place within the Maryhill Hub, located within the Wyndford estate and the Ashgill Recreation Centre - located within Milton. Community Safety Glasgow were successful in gaining funding from Cube Housing Assocation to create a digital inclusion programme that has operated from November 2014 - November 2015. Cube Housing are unable to fund year two of this programme. The Digital Challenge Fund will allow our digital inclusion programme to continue for year two, splitting our member of staff between the Maryhill Hub and Ashgill Recreation Centre.

The project will offer members of the community free access to the internet via our 20 station learning centre within the Maryhill Hub and 14 station centre within the Ashgill Recreation Centre. Free Wi-fi will also be provided. As well as informal drop in, the programme will co-ordinate a range of partners to utalise the learning centre to provide support to clients such as Jobs and Bussiness Glasgow, Glasgow Life, Citizens Advice Service and Glasgow Kelvin College. This will allow a range of informal and formal learning to take place.

As well as co-ordination, the Digital Inclusion Officer will also undertake one to one and group work support sessions around issues such as employability and financial inclusion.

The ICT equipment that will be used are connected to Glasgow Kelvin College’s network and our two centres, built in 2014 (Maryhill) and 2015 (Milton) are all new equipment.

The Maryhill Digital Inclusion programme will also seek to engage volunteers within the centre to support clients. Currently we have one digital inclusion volunteer who contributes 14 hours per week within Maryhill.

### Planned project milestones

* Extend Digital Inclusion Programme to Ashgill Recreation Centre (Dec 15 - Oct 15)
* Continue Digital Inclusion Programme with Maryhill Hub (Dec 15 - Oct 15)
* Recruit and Train 5 Digital Inclusion Volunteers
* Review sustainability of project (External Funding / Volunteers Engagement)


### Planned outputs and outcomes

* Residents of Maryhill and Milton have a better understanding of how to access ICT
* Increased support in accessing employability support and knowledge to stop unnecessary government sanctions
* Increase in accredited and unaccredited learning opportunities


### Evaluation

## Evaluation Uodate January 2017

In the last 12 months the Maryhill and Milton Digital Inclusion Programme has helped over 1244 people from 50 different nationalities gain access to a PC and get online. Statistics supplied by Glasgow Kelvin College inform us that we have had over 20,000 logins at the Ashgill Recreation Centre and the Maryhill Hub Learning Centres. From October 2015 to October 2016 we have had over 1244 new registered users and we have received over 300 hundred referrals from the DWP to assist Clients with Employability Issues. The Digital Programme continues grow and develop and we have engaged with various partners throughout the north of Glasgow from Glasgow Life, (delivering Basic and Intermediate IT classes), Glasgow Kelvin College (delivering Wider access and Youth Access programmes) and Jobs & Business Glasgow (providing employability assistance) etc… to deliver their services within the Learning Centres. We have also recruited our second Digital Inclusion Volunteer who has agreed to commit 4 hours a week to assist in the Learning Centres.  This year we also opened our third Learning Centre situated within our Enterprise Centre in the east end of Glasgow which will assist Individual's within the Criminal Justice System to gain new ICT skills which will further their opportunities in the wider community. We anticipate that this new project will be as successful as our current Digital Programme.

### Lessons learned

Overall, we have co-ordinated our efforts into engaging with the community and our partners to deliver a successful Digital programme within our Click & Connect Learning Centres.
We identified early on that many within our communities lacked the basic knowledge to get online and set about delivering a comprehensive timetable that would address the needs of the public.
We have engaged effectively to ensure that clients accessing the Learning Centres, many of which have complex needs, language barriers and low self-confidence can have a quality customer experience.
On reflection, we have realised that although we endeavour to help with all things digital there is a limit to what we can achieve with certain individuals many of whom require one to one tuition before moving on to further develop their ICT skills.

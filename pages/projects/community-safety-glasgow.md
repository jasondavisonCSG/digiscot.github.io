### Project description

The project will take place within the Maryhill Hub, located within the Wyndford estate and the Ashgill Recreation Centre - located within Milton. Community Safety Glasgow were successful in gaining funding from Cube Housing Assocation to create a digital inclusion programme that has operated from November 2014 - November 2015. Cube Housing are unable to fund year two of this programme. The Digital Challenge Fund will allow our digital inclusion programme to continue for year two, splitting our member of staff between the Maryhill Hub and Ashgill Recreation Centre.

The project will offer members of the community free access to the internet via our 20 station learning centre within the Maryhill Hub and 14 station centre within the Ashgill Recreation Centre. Free Wi-fi will also be provided. As well as informal drop in, the programme will co-ordinate a range of partners to utalise the learning centre to provide support to clients such as Jobs and Bussiness Glasgow, Glasgow Life, Citizens Advice Service and Glasgow Kelvin College. This will allow a range of informal and formal learning to take place.

As well as co-ordination, the Digital Inclusion Officer will also undertake one to one and group work support sessions around issues such as employability and financial inclusion.

The ICT equipment that will be used are connected to Glasgow Kelvin Collegeâ€™s network and our two centres, built in 2014 (Maryhill) and 2015 (Milton) are all new equipment.

The Maryhill Digital Inclusion programme will also seek to engage volunteers within the centre to support clients. Currently we have one digital inclusion volunteer who contributes 14 hours per week within Maryhill.

### Planned project milestones

* Extend Digital Inclusion Programme to Ashgill Recreation Centre (Dec 15 - Oct 15)
* Continue Digital Inclusion Programme with Maryhill Hub (Dec 15 - Oct 15)
